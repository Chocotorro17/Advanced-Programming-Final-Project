# Advanced-Programming-Final-Project
Our final project for this course. It contains OOP-related codes.
Here's a short description of every code here:

1) Classes:
It's the introductory code  --yet, at the same time, one that contains many things. It contains a basic example of a class, which we called "Employee", with just one method and one constructor. However, this code was used all through the unit, so we kept adding more things. By the end, we had a second class --called Car-- which has getters, copy-constructors, a destructor, friend classes and friend functions. Although we didn't utilise everything in the main() function, it serves as a reference on how things are done.
